# Implementation-of-the-a-priori-algorithm-for-a-recommendation-system-based-on-product-associations.
This repository contains an implementation of the "a priori" algorithm which consists in making a recommendation system based on the associations of products purchased by users. 

In most products that have a relationship (user-product) and this has a database that contains a one-to-many relationship; as data scientists we are interested in discovering what are the frequent relationships and/or associations in this relationship.

It has a very frequent use case, because the marketer's mission is to keep the user in retention, and through historical consumer behavior, we can begin to see frequent relationships between products.

That is why, in this project, we will be looking at the basic implementation of the "a priori" algorithm with python for
